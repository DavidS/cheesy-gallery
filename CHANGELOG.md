# 1.1.0

* Adds aggressive caching to reduce rebuild times.
  If you need to re-render images for any reason, remove the `.jekyll-cache` folder or change the `_config.yml` file.

* Changes default quality to 85, and instead strips alls comments.
  This results in better quality pictures with less size.
